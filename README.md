# Online Ecommerce Website Project in JSP
<hr>
<p align="right">Created and designed by AD Singh
<hr>
In this project, I have tried to build an E-commerce website, which can simulate all the basic controls that an actual shopping website has.
<br>
I have used eclipse photon, java 1.8, tomcat 8.5 and MySQL 5.7.31
<br>
<p>Thanx for using <u>Ecommerce Website Project</u></p>
